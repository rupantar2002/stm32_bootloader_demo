# stm32_bootloader_demo
This project demonstrates a custom bootloader for the STM32F407VGT6 Discovery board. The bootloader allows the device to boot into one of two applications (App1 or App2) based on the state of a GPIO pin at startup. The primary goal is to illustrate how to implement multi-application booting using a simple example.
